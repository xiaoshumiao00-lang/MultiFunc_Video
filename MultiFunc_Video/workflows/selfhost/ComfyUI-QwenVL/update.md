# Release Notes: v2.1.1 (2026-02-08)
- Fixed Transformers compatibility: works on both **Transformers 4.x** and **5.x** (thanks to **Sepolian** for identifying the issue and sharing the fix in [PR #130](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-QwenVL/pull/130); we adjusted the implementation to keep it compatible across both versions).

# Release Notes: v2.1.0 (2026-02-05)

### 🚀 SageAttention Support

Introducing **SageAttention** - A high-performance attention mechanism with GPU-optimized kernels for maximum inference speed.

- **Per-GPU Architecture Optimization**: Automatically selects the best kernel for your GPU:
  - **SM120 (Blackwell)**: FP8 kernels for RTX 50-series
  - **SM90 (Hopper)**: Optimized FP8 kernels for H100
  - **SM89 (Ada)**: FP8 kernels for RTX 40-series
  - **SM80+ (Ampere)**: FP16 kernels for RTX 30-series and A100

- **Smart Attention Selection**: The new "auto" mode now tries Sage → Flash → SDPA in order of performance
- **Easy Installation**: Simply `pip install sageattention` to enable

### 🎯 Improved FP8 Model Handling

- **Automatic SDPA Fallback**: FP8 models now automatically use SDPA regardless of attention mode selection
- **Better Memory Management**: Improved cache clearing when switching between FP8 and regular models
- **Meta Tensor Fix**: Resolved "Cannot copy out of meta tensor" errors when loading FP8 models

### 📊 Progress Bar

Added ComfyUI-native progress bar for better visibility during:
- Model loading stages
- Generation progress
- Clear visual feedback on current operation

### 🧠 Intelligent Cache Management

- **Automatic VRAM Clearing**: When changing attention modes, quantization, or model configurations
- **Signature-Based Reloading**: Smart detection of configuration changes ensures proper model reloading
- **Memory Optimization**: Better handling of model unloading to prevent VRAM leaks

### ⚙️ Attention Mode Updates

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **auto** | Tries Sage → Flash → SDPA (best performance) |
| **sage** | Forces SageAttention (requires `pip install sageattention`) |
| **flash_attention_2** | Forces Flash Attention 2 |
| **sdpa** | PyTorch SDPA (default, always works) |

**Note**: FP8 models and BitsAndBytes quantization automatically use SDPA.

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Qwen3-VL Support**: SageAttention now properly patches Qwen3VLTextAttention layers
- **Better Error Handling**: Clearer messages when attention modes fail to load
- **Device Support**: Improved handling for CUDA, MPS, and CPU devices with FP8 models

# Release Notes: v2.0.0 (2025-12-22)

### New GGUF Nodes
We've expanded our GGUF model support with three powerful new nodes:

- **QwenVL (GGUF)** — Lightweight GGUF-based vision node for image/video understanding and text generation. Offers significantly faster inference speed compared to Transformers models, making it ideal for real-time workflows and resource-constrained environments.
- **QwenVL (GGUF) Advanced** — Enhanced GGUF vision node with additional controls for advanced users. Maintains the ultra-fast inference speed of GGUF while providing fine-tuned control over generation parameters.
- **Qwen Prompt Enhancer (GGUF)** — GGUF text-only node for intelligent prompt rewriting and enhancement (not a vision model). Delivers rapid prompt enhancement with minimal resource usage, perfect for iterative prompt refinement workflows.
- **Qwen Prompt Enhancer (Transformers)** — Uses Qwen3 transformer model to enhance and rewrite prompts. Analyzes your input prompt and intelligently expands it with better detail, structure, and clarity for improved generation quality. Offers full model capabilities with precise control over the enhancement process.

### Enhanced GPU Device Selection (Advanced Node)
The **QwenVL (Advanced)** node now offers flexible GPU device management:

- **Manual GPU selection** — Choose specific CUDA devices (e.g., `cuda:1`, `cuda:2`) instead of defaulting to `cuda:0`
- **Automatic device detection** — Dynamically discovers all available CUDA devices on your system
- **Improved device mapping** — More consistent behavior and better resource allocation
- **OOM prevention** — Route models to underutilized GPUs when your primary GPU is handling diffusion workloads

*Note: The basic QwenVL node continues to use automatic device selection for simplicity*

## ✨ Improvements

### GGUF: Quality and Usability

**Cleaner Outputs by Default:**
- Automatically removes common "thinking/planning" content and leaked tokens (`<think>`, `<im_start>`, `<im_end>`)
- Users now receive clean, usable prompt-only or answer-only text without manual filtering

**QwenVL (GGUF) Vision Node:**
- Model dropdown now displays actual `.gguf` filenames with automatic deduplication for easier model identification
- Enhanced download progress logging with clear status messages during model download and cache reuse
- Token generation speed reporting (`tok/s`) when available — helps compare different models and quantization levels

**Qwen Prompt Enhancer (GGUF):**
- Updated built-in presets to reduce "junk talk" and return clean enhanced prompts more consistently
- Refined system prompts that minimize verbose output
- More reliable prompt-only text generation

### Transformers Nodes: GPU and Attention Stability


**Advanced GPU Routing:**
- `QwenVL (Advanced)` supports selecting specific GPUs (e.g., `cuda:1`, `cuda:2`) to avoid OOM when GPU0 is busy
- Improved device-mapping logic for more consistent behavior across different hardware configurations

**Attention Backend Stability:**
- Flash-Attention auto mode now behaves safely across all platforms
- Gracefully falls back to SDPA when Flash-Attention dependencies are unavailable
- Prevents runtime errors from missing or incompatible Flash-Attention installations

## Version 1.1.0 (2025/11/11)

⚡ Major Performance Optimization Update

This release introduces a full rework of the QwenVL runtime to significantly improve speed, stability, and GPU utilization.

![QwenVL_V1.1.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13e89746-a04e-41a3-9026-7079b29e149c)

### 🚀 Core Improvements
- **Flash Attention Integration (Auto Detection)**  
  Automatically leverages next-generation attention optimization for faster inference on supported GPUs, while falling back to SDPA when needed.
- **Attention Mode Selector**  
  Both QwenVL nodes expose the attention backend (auto / flash_attention_2 / sdpa) so users can quickly validate which mode performs best on their hardware without leaving the basic workflow view.
- **Precision Optimization**  
  Smarter internal precision handling improves throughput and keeps performance consistent across high-end and low-VRAM cards.
- **Runtime Acceleration**  
  The execution pipeline now keeps KV cache/device alignment always-on, cutting per-run overhead and reducing latency.
- **Caching System**  
  Models remain cached in memory between runs, drastically lowering reload times when prompts change.
- **Video Frame Optimization**  
  Streamlined frame sampling and preprocessing accelerate video-focused workflows.
- **Hardware Adaptation**  
  Smarter device detection ensures the best configuration across NVIDIA GPUs, Apple Silicon, and CPU fallback scenarios.

### 🧠 Developer Enhancements
- Unified model and processor loading with cleaner logging and fewer bottlenecks.  
- Refined quantization and memory handling for better stability across quant modes.  
- Improved fallback behavior when advanced GPU optimizations are unavailable.

### 💡 Compatibility
- Fully backward compatible with existing ComfyUI workflows.  
- Retains both **QwenVL** and **QwenVL (Advanced)** nodes: the basic node now bundles the most useful speed controls, while the advanced node exposes every knob (quantization, attention, device, torch.compile) for deep tuning.

### 🔧 Recommended
- PyTorch ≥ 2.8.0  
- CUDA 12.4 or later  
- Flash Attention 2.x (optional, for maximum performance)

> Switching quantization or attention modes forces a one-time model reload and is expected behavior when comparing runtime profiles.
### Version 1.0.4 (2025/10/31)

🆕 **Custom Model Support Added**
- Users can now add their own **custom Qwen-VL or Hugging Face models**  
  by creating a `custom_models.json` file in the plugin directory.  
  These models will automatically appear in the model selection list.

- Added automatic merging of user-defined models from `custom_models.json`,  
  following the same flexible mechanism as in *ComfyUI-JoyCaption*.

- Added detailed documentation  
  👉 [`docs/custom_models.md`](./docs/custom_models.md)  
  and an editable example file [`custom_models_example.json`](./custom_models_example.json).

⚙️ **Dependency Update**

- Updated **Transformers** version requirement:  
  `transformers>=4.57.0` (was `>=4.40.0`)  
  to ensure full compatibility with **Qwen3-VL** models.
